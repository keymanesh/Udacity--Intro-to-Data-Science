# Analyzing the NYC Subway Dataset

In this project, I analyzed NYC Subway data and figure out the relationship between weather and use of subway. For example, does rain influence people's decision to use subway? How about tempeture or wind?

By Wrangling the NYC subway data, using statistical methods and data visualization, some interesting conclusion about the subway dataset have been drawn.
